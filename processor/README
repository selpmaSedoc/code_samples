Hello,

This code sample comes from a class project wherein I implemented a processor in verilog.

The code for the processor is contained in the verilog/src/ directory.

The cpp/src/ directory contains a toy program I wrote to complement the processor; it takes an
input file (similar to x86 assembly syntax that I created) and generates machine code from it;
this output file can be read in and executed by the verilog processor module.

I chose this particular set of programs as a code sample since I felt that it is a good measure of
one's good coding practice if someone else unfamiliar with the chosen language can still read and
understand the program easily. Hence, Verilog. (I am currently working on writing a simulator for
VHDL, another hardware-description language, but that is still a work-in-progress.)
