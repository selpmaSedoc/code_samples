Hello,

This code sample comes from a class project wherein I implemented a processor
in verilog.

The code for the processor is contained in the verilog/src/ directory.

The cpp/src/ directory contains a toy program I wrote to complement the
processor; it takes an input file (similar to x86 assembly syntax that I
created) and generates machine code from it; this output file can be read in
and executed by the verilog processor module.

I chose this particular set of programs as a code sample since I felt that it
is a good measure of one's good coding practice if someone else unfamiliar with
the chosen language can still read and understand the program easily. Hence,
the hardware-description language Verilog, which I'm assuming is not used by
most of the companies I am applying to.
